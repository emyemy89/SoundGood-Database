This database project is part of our univerity work during the course IK1451 'Data Storage Paradigms' at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

It develops a database starting from Conceptual Modeling, all the way to implementing a Java application that ensures ACID transactions.

The business overview of SoundGood Music School is the following:

  "Soundgood sells music lessons to students who want to learn to play an instrument. When someone wants to attend the school, 
   they submit contact details, which instrument they want to learn, and their present skill. If there is room, the student is offered a place. 
   There is no concept like 'course' or sets of lessons. Instead, students continue to take lessons as long as they wish. Students pay per lesson 
   and instructors are payed per given lesson."
